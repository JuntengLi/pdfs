	> Here we developed a dynamic sensor-regulator system (DSRS) to produce fatty acid
	--based products in Escherichia coli, and demonstrated its use for biodiesel
	production.  ...... This DSRS substantially improved the stability of
	biodiesel-producing strains and increased the titer to 1.5 g/l and the yield
	threefold to 28% of the theoretical maximum

	> These strains produced threefold higher titers of FAEE compared to that produced
	by the previously engineered A2A strain, reaching 1.5 g/l after 3 d incubation,
	corresponding to 28% of the maximum theoretical yield.

	> To determine if the DSRS increased product yields because of the improved
	metabolic balance, we performed metabolite analysis on five strains using
	either PlacUV5 or the biosensor-derived promoters to control the expression of
	genes in the ethanol pathway (Supplementary Table 1). When PlacUV5 was used,
	ethanol accumulated to 4.3 g/l at 24 h but decreased dramatically afterwards
	(Fig. 4a). In contrast, the biosensor-derived promoters produced ethanol more
	consistently. Less ethanol accumulated at 24 h and the ethanol productivity
	remained nearly constant during 3 d of production. Furthermore, strains using
	biosensor-derived promoters produced less acetate than the strain that harbored
	PlacUV5, suggesting that central metabolism was balanced better with the
	biosensor-derived promoters (Fig. 4b). In addition, we characterized the time-
	dependent behavior of a dynamic promoter, PFL3, in the best FAEE-producing
	strain W and compared it to that of the inducible promoter PlacUV5 in strain X
	(Fig. 4c). Under our production conditions, PFL3 turned on more quickly and
	dynamically adjusted itself to remain induced at the desired level, resulting
	in higher FAEE titer.
