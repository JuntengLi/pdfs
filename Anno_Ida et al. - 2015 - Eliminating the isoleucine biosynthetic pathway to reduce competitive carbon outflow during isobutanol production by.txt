	> Isobutanol is an important biorefinery target alcohol that can be used as a
	fuel, fuel additive, or  ...... commodity chemical. Baker's yeast,
	Saccharomyces cerevisiae, is a promising organism for the industrial
	manufacture of isobutanol because of its tolerance for low pH and resistance to
	autolysis. I  ...... The isobutyrate, pantothenate or isoleucine biosynthetic
	pathways were deleted to reduce the outflow of carbon competing with isobutanol
	biosynthesis in S. cerevisiae.  ...... The titer and yield of this engineered
	strain was 224 ± 5 mg/L and 12.04 ± 0.23 mg/g glucose, respectively.

	> Isobutanol production by BY4741 single-gene knockout strains. BY4741-emp and
	ΔXXXX-emp are the control strains harboring the pATP426 empty vector.
	BY4741-kAI and ΔXXXX-kAI harbor the pATP426-kivd-ADH6-ILV2 plasmid for
	enhancing isobutanol biosynthesis. Cells were inoculated at an OD600 of 2 and
	grown in SD minimal or selectable media. For ΔILV1 strains, 60 mg/L of
	isoleucine was added to the SD medium. The concentration of isobutanol in the
	medium of each culture after 2 days of fermentation was determined using GC-MS.
	Each data point represents the mean (SD) values obtained from 3 replicate
	fermentations

	> The highest concentration of isobutanol obtained was 70 ± 3 mg/L after 2 days
	fermentation in the presence of 12 mg/L isoleucine.

	> Figure 4 shows the time course change in several fermentation products in the
	medium. YPH499ΔILV1-kAI and YPH499ΔILV1-kAI-PMsM produced 153 ± 3 mg/L and 224
	± 5 mg/L of isobutanol, respectively, a 2.1- and 3.1-fold increase compared to
	YPH499ΔILV1-emp.

	> Time course of cultivation of and fermentation by YPH499ΔILV1 strain in
	isoleucine-containing media. (a) YPH499ΔILV1 was inoculated at an OD600 of 0.1
	and cultured in SD minimal medium containing 0, 1.25, 3, 6, 12, 18, 24 or 30
	mg/L isoleucine. Cell growth was determined by measuring OD600 using a
	spectrophotometer. (b)(c)(d)(e) YPH499ΔILV1 was inoculated at an OD600 of 2 and
	grown in SD minimal medium containing different concentrations of isoleucine.
	The cell growth was determined by measuring the OD600 using a
	spectrophotometer, and the concentrations of isobutanol, ethanol, and the total
	of 2-methyl-1-butanol and 3-methyl-1-butanol, in the media were determined
	using GC-MS. Each data point represents the mean (SD) values obtained from 3
	replicate fermentations

	> Media, cultivation and fermentation conditions BY4741 and the single-gene
	deletion mutants were cultured at 30°C in 5 mL of SD minimal medium (6.7 g/L

	> glucose) containing 20 mg/L histidine, 60 mg/L leucine, 20 mg/L methionine and
	20 mg/L uracil. For BY4741 ΔILV1 strain, 60 mg/L isoleucine was added. The
	transformants were cultured in SD selectable medium (lacking uracil for plasmid
	maintenance). YPH499ΔILV1 strain was cultured in SD minimal medium containing
	40 mg/L adenine, 20 mg/L histidine, 60 mg/L leucine, 20 mg/L lysine, 40 mg/L
	tryptophan, 20 mg/L uracil and 0 ~ 60 mg/L isoleucine. The transformants were
	cultured in SD selectable medium lacking uracil and/or histidine. All yeast
	cells were cultured in 5 mL of medium in test tubes for 3 days. The cells were
	inoculated into 5 mL of fresh SD minimal or selectable medium at an OD600 of
	0.1 to test cell growth in isoleucine-supplemented medium. For some
	experiments, the cells were centrifuged and washed, then inoculated at an OD600
	of 2 to test isobutanol production. For all experiments, growth was conducted
	in 5 mL of medium in test tubes at 30°C, 150 opm for up to 4 days.
