	> A lactate producing derivative of Escherichia coli KO11, strain SZ110, was re-
	engineered for ethanol production by deleting genes encoding all fermentative
	routes for NADH and randomly inserting a promoterless mini-Tn5 cassette
	(transpososome) containing the complete Zymomonas mobilis ethanol pathway (pdc,
	adhA, and adhB) into the chromosome.  ...... This strain fermented 9% (w/v)
	xylose to 4% (w/v) ethanol in 48 h in mineral salts medium, nearly equal to the
	performance of KO11 with Luria broth.

	> Fermentation tests were carried out in 500 ml fermentation vessels with
	automatic pH control (37°C, pH 6.5, and 150 rpm, 350 ml working volume)
	(Underwood et al. 2004) using NBS mineral salts medium containing 9% (w/v)
	xylose, and 1 mM betaine. Pre-inocula were grown in standing screw-capped tubes
	at 37°C for 24--48 h in NBS mineral salts medium containing 5% (w/v) xylose and
	1 mM betaine, and transferred to small fermentors. After incubation for 24 h,
	this culture was used to provide an initial inoculum level -1  of 10--16 mg dry
	cell wt (dcw)1 .
