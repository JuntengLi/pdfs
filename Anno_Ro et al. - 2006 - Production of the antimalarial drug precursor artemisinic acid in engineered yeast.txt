	> Here we report the engineering of Saccharomyces 21  cerevisiae to produce high
	titres (up to 100 mg l ) of artemisinic acid using an engineered mevalonate
	pathway, amorphadiene synthase, and a novel cytochrome P450 monooxygenase
	(CYP71AV1) from A. annua that performs a three-step oxidation of
	amorpha-4,11-diene to artemisinic acid. The synthesized artemisinic acid is
	transported out and retained on the outside of the engineered yeast, meaning
	that a simple and inexpensive purification process can be used to obtain the
	desired product. Although the engineered yeast is already capable of producing
	artemisinic acid at a significantly higher specific productivity than A. annua,
	yield optimization and industrial scale-up will be required to raise
	artemisinic acid production to a level high enough to reduce artemisinin
	combination therapies to significantly below their current prices

	> To test for improvements in FPP production, we expressed ADS under the control
	of the GAL1 promoter on the pRS425 plasmid (see Supplementary Information for
	details). Yeast engineered with ADS alone produced a low quantity of
	amorphadiene (Fig. 2, strain EPY201, 4.4 mg l  21  amorphadiene).

	> Although upc2-1, a semi-dominant mutant allele that enhances the activity of
	UPC2 (a global transcription factor regulating the biosynthesis of sterols in
	14  S. cerevisiae) , , had only a modest effect on amorphadiene production when
	overexpressed in the EPY208 background (Fig. 2, strain EPY210), the combination
	of downregulating ERG9 and overexpressing upc2-1 increased amorphadiene
	production to 105 mg l  21  (Fig. 2, strain EPY213). Integration of an
	additional copy of tHMGR into the chromosome further increased amorphadiene
	production by 50% to 149 mg l  21  (Fig. 2, strain EPY219). Although
	overexpression of the gene encoding FPP synthase (ERG20) had little effect on
	total amorphadiene production (Fig. 2, strain EPY224), the specific production
	increased by about 10% owing to a decrease in cell density. Combining all of
	these modifications resulted in a strain (EPY224) able to produce 153 mg l  21
	amorphadiene, a sesquiterpene production level nearly 500-fold 15  higher than
	previously reported .

	> Fermentation and product analyses. A one-litre bioreactor (New-Brunswick
	Scientific) was used to culture the transgenic yeast strain for 93 h at 30 8C.
	Yeast cells were induced with 2% galactose at an A 600 of 1.7, and the final
	cell density reached an A 600 of 5.0. The dissolved oxygen level was maintained
	at 40% by altering 21  agitation speed from 100 to 500 r.p.m. and sparging air
	at 0.5 l min . Artemisinic acid was removed from the cell pellet by an alkaline
	wash as before, and purified through a silica column eluted with 78% hexane,
	20% ethyl acetate and 2% acetic acid.
