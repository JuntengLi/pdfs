	> Here, we report the development of the genetically defined L-threonine
	overproducing Escherichia coli strain by systems metabolic engineering  ......
	The final engineered E. coli strain was able to produce Thr with a high yield
	of 0.393 g per gram of glucose, and 82.4 g/l Thr by fed-batch culture.

	> We first constructed a Thr-producing E. coli base strain from WL3110, a lacI-
	mutant strain of W3110, using the metabolic and regulatory information
	available in the literature

	> When recombinant TH07 (pBRThrABC) strain was flask cultured in TPM1 medium
	containing 50 g/l glucose for 48 h, the final Thr concentration of 10.1 g/l (a
	yield of 0.202 g Thr per gram of glucose) was obtained

	> To our surprise, however, Thr production was rather decreased by 17.1% compared
	to the control strain TH07 (pBRThrABC, pACYC177). When the ppcdeleted strain
	TH11C (pBRThrABC, pACYC177) was cultured under the same condition, Thr
	production significantly decreased by 87%, which suggested that PPC is
	necessary for Thr production

	> Batch culture of TH09C (pBRThrABC) resulted in the production of 1.93 g/l Thr (a
	yield of 0.186 g Thr per gram of glucose), which is 30.4% higher  than  that
	obtained  with  the  control  TH07C (pBRThrABC) strain (  ...... Batch culture
	of TH20C (pBRThrABC) resulted in the production of 2.24 g/l Thr (a yield of
	0.213 g Thr per gram of glucose), which is 51.4% higher than that obtained with
	the control TH07 (pBRThrABC) strain

	> When the resulting TH27C (pBRThrABC) strain was batch cultured in TPM2 medium
	containing 30 g/l glucose, 7.4 g/l of Thr (a yield of 0.246 g Thr per gram of
	glucose) was produced. This is 15.6% higher than that obtained with TH20C
	(pBRThrABC) under the same culture condition.

	> Batch culture of this strain in TPM2 medium containing 30 g/l glucose resulted
	in the production of 11.1 g/l Thr (a yield of 0.370 g Thr per gram of glucose),
	which is 50.2% higher than that obtained without rhtC amplification

	> We thus performed fed-batch culture of TH27C (pBRThrABCR3) strain with
	intermittent glucose feeding (see Materials and methods), which allowed
	production of 77.1 g/l Thr in 56.1 h, resulting in a volumetric Thr
	productivity of 1.37 g/l/h

	> The final Thr concentration reached 82.4 g/l in 50 h, with a volumetric
	productivity of 1.65 g/l/h (Supplementary Table III), which is 20.4% higher
	than that obtained with TH27C (pBRThrABCR3) strain, and is comparable to a
	value typically obtained with a randomly mutagenized industrial strain.

	> Batch and fed-batch cultivation  ...... Batch and fed-batch cultures were
	carried out using the TPM2 medium containing the indicated amount of glucose at
	311C. The TPM2  ...... . O47medium contains the following per liter: yeast
	extract, 2 g;  . MgSO47 H2O, 2 g; KH2PO4, 2 g; (NH4)2SO4, 10 g; L-methionine,
	0.2 g; L-lysine, 0.2 g; L-isoleucine, 0.05 g; and trace metal solution, 10 ml.
	Glucose was added to give the final concentration of 10 or 30 g/l depending on
	the experiments described in the text. Chloramphenicol (35 mg/ml), kanamycin
	(40 mg/ml), and ampicillin (50 mg/ml) were added to the medium when necessary.
	Seed cultures were prepared by transferring 500 ml of 10 ml overnight cultures
	prepared in Luria--Bertani (LB) medium into 250 ml Erlenmeyer flasks containing
	50 ml LB medium and cultured at 311C with 250 r.p.m. Cultured cells were used
	to inoculate the fermentor containing 2 l of TPM2 medium. Batch fermentations
	were carried out in a 6.6-l Bioflo 3000 fermentor (New Brunswick Scientific
	Co., Edison, NJ). The pH was controlled at 6.5 by automatic feeding of 25%
	(v/v) NH4OH. The dissolved oxygen concentration was maintained above 40% of air
	saturation by supplying air at 1 vvm (air volume/working volume/minute) and by
	automatically controlling the agitation speed up to 1000 rpm.

	> Fed-batch cultures were carried out in a 6.6-l Bioflo 3000 fermentor containing
	2 l of TPM2 medium containing 20 g/l glucose at 311C. Feeding solution was made
	of 500 g/l glucose, 12.5 g/l KH2PO4, 3 g/l L-methionine,  and 4.357 g/l
	L-lysine. When the glucose concentration in the culture broth fell to 1 g/l, 80
	ml of feeding solution (thus, equivalent to 40 g glucose, 1 g KH2PO4, 0.24 g
	L-methionine, and 0.35 g L-lysine)  was added. The dissolved oxygen
	concentration was controlled at 40% of air saturation by automatically
	increasing the agitation speed up to 1000 r.p.m. and by changing the percentage
	of pure oxygen added. The pH was controlled at 6.5 by automatic feeding of 25%
	(v/v) NH4OH. The pH-stat fed-batch fermentation was carried out similarly. When
	glucose becomes exhausted, the pH increases. When the pH becomes higher than
	6.59, 6 ml of feeding solution
