	> Growth medium. All controlled batch bioreactor studies used Lauria Berni (LB)
	rich medium containing 5 g/liter NaCl, 5 g/liter yeast extract, 10 iter
	trypone, 80 g/liter total sugars (unless otherwise specified), and 10 /ml
	tetracycline. The LB components were autoclaved. The sugars and racycline were
	sterile filtered and added into bioreactors. Growth experients conducted in
	baffled shake flasks used defined medium containing 12.8 iter Na2HPO4.7H2O, 3
	g/liter KH2PO4, 0.5 g/liter NaCl, 1 g/liter NH4Cl, % (vol/vol) 1 M MgSO , 0.01
	g/liter CaCl , 0.1% (vol/vol) stock trace etals solution, 1 mg/liter thiamine,
	2 g/liter xylose, and 2 g/liter glucose. The ock trace metal solutions
	consisted of 0.15 g/liter H3BO4, 0.065 g/liter SO4, 0.05 g/liter ZnSO4.7H2O,
	0.015 g/liter MnCl2.4H2O, 0.015 g/liter Mo4.2H2O, 0.01 g/liter r Fe(NH )

	Germany) with a working volume of 6 liters under anaerobic conditions. e
	temperature and agitation rate were set at 37°C and 200 rpm, respecely. Single
	colonies were picked from freshly streaked plates and grown ernight in 15-ml

	> ble 5). Determination of the ethanol production kinetics on a mixre of 40
	g/liter glucose and 40 g/liter xylose showed that G1655/pLOI297 consumed first
	glucose and then xylose in a quential manner. As shown in Fig. 4E, it took
	MG1655/ LOI297 only about 12 h to completely consume glucose but h to consume
	just 20% of 40 g/liter xylose. The slow xylose nsumption rate of the wild type
	after the glucose was conmed was probably due to a combination of cellular
	inhibitory fects resulting from the formation of by-products such as ccinic
	acid, lactic acid, acetic acid, ethanol, and formic acid. G1655/pLOI297
	achieved an ethanol yield of 0.40 ⫾ 0.02 (g hanol/g sugar) and an ethanol titer
	of 18.66 ⫾ 1.01 (g/liter). contrast, TCS083/pLOI297 did not show pronounced
	diuxic growth behavior. It could simultaneously consume both ucose and xylose
	and completely utilize all sugars within 48 h. CS083/pLOI297 reached a biomass
	concentration of 3.54 ⫾ 16 g/liter (Fig. 4F). Assuming that both sugars equally
	conbuted to the biomass formation reaction, this translates to e use of 32% ⫾
	1% of the sugars for growth and the conrsion of the rest into ethanol at
	theoretical values to reach a nal titer of 39.46 ⫾ 0.57 g/liter. The
