	> Two strategies were used to modulate expression of transhydrogenase (pntAB) and
	NAD kinase (yfjB) genes to increase NADPH supply for improving isobutanol
	production. Plasmid overexpression of pntAB and yfjB genes either individually
	or in combination had little effect on isobutanol production.  ......
	Modulating pntAB gene alone led to 20% and 8% increase of anaerobic isobutanol
	titer and yield. Although modulating yfjB gene alone had nearly no effect,
	modulating pntAB and yfjB genes in combination led to 50% and 30% increase of
	isobutanol titer and yield in comparison with modulating pntAB gene alone. It
	was also found that increasing pntAB gene expression alone had a threshold for
	improving anaerobic isobutanol production, while activating NAD kinase could
	break through this threshold, leading to a yield of 0.92 mol/mo  ...... This
	strategy will be useful for improving production of target compounds using
	NADPH as reducing equivalent within their synthetic pathways. In addition,
	combined activation of PntAB and YfjB led to 28% and 22% increase of aerobic
	isobutanol titer and yield, resulting in production of 10.8 g/L isobutanol in
	24 h with a yield of 0.62 mol/mol

	cultures were grown aerobically at 30 1C, 37 1C, or 39 1C in Luria broth (per
	liter: 10 g Difco tryptone, 5 g Difco yeast extract. and 10 g NaCl) containing
	20 g glucose/L. Ampicillin (100 mg L  1  ), kanamycin (25 mg L  1  ), and
	chloramphenicol (17 mg L  1  ) were used where appropriate.

	> Single colonies were picked from plates and inoculated into 250 ml flasks
	containing 50 ml NBS (New Brunswick Scientific) mineral salts medium (Zhang et
	al., 2009b) with 5% glucose, and grown at 37 1C and 200 rpm for 12 h. For
	aerobic fermentation, seed culture was inoculated into 250 mL flasks containing
	50 mL NBS medium with 5% glucose and 100 mM MOPS, and grown at 37 1C and 250
	rpm for 24 h. For anaerobic fermentation, seed culture was inoculated into 100
	mL screw cap bottles containing 50 mL NBS medium with 5% glucose and 100 mM
	MOPS, and grown at 37 1C without shaking for 6 days. For cultivating in rich
	medium, 10 g/L yeast extract was added into the NBS medium. For a two-stage
	fermentation process, strains were first cultivated aerobically in NBS medium
	to an OD550 of 3.0--5.0, and then shifting to anaerobic conditions by flushing
	with oxygen-free atmosphere in a 100 mL screw cap bottles. The cultures were
	then incubated without shaking at 37 1C, and were swirled twice a day. Samples
	were taken at the time of the anaerobic shift and 24 h after induction. For
	each strain, three independent fermentations were performed

	> In order to improve isobutanol production, the expression of kivD-ilvD operon
	was modulated with a previously constructed regulatory part M1-93. The
	resulting strain AS29 produced 3.0 mM isobutanol with a yield of 0.04 mol/mol

	condition, and produced 25 mM isobutanol with a yield of 0.52 mol/mol under
	anaerobic condition (Fig. 2). Both titer and yield increased significantly
	after utilizing AlsS, suggesting that conversion of pyruvate to acetolactate
	was the rate-limiting step for isobutanol synthesis. In order to further
	increase AHAS activity, a second copy of alsS gene together with regulatory
	part M1-64 were integrated into AS77 at ldhA site, resulting in strain AS105
	(Table 1). This strain produced 65 mM isobutanol with a yield of 0.41 mol/mol
	under aerobic condition, and produced 26 mM isobutanol with a yield of 0.66

	highest isobutanol titer among all modulated strains. This strain produced 114
	mM isobutanol with a yield of 0.51 mol/mol under aerobic condition, and

	> The pntAB gene of strain AS108 was modulated with 4 regulatory parts (M1-93,
	M1-37, M1-46 and M1-30), resulting in strains AS142 to AS145 (Table 1). Under
	anaerobic condition, similar improvement of isobutanol titer (14% to 20%) and
	yield (5% and 8%) were obtained in all modulated strains except AS144 which was
	modulated with M1-46 (Table 2). Titer and yield decreased 34% and 6% in strain
	AS144. The pntAB gene expression levels of the modulated strains were compared
	with parent strain AS108 through RT-PCR analysis. M1-93 led to the biggest
	increase of expression level (40-fold). M1-37 and M1-30 led to 25-fold
	increase, while M1-46 led to the smallest increase of expression level
	(20-fold) (Fig. 5A).

	> In order to investigate the effect of different fermentation processes on
	isobutanol production, a two-stage process as described previously (Bastian et
	al., 2011) was used to cultivate AS166 for isobutanol production. This strain
	produced 75 mM isobutanol in 24 h. Productivity and yield were 0.07 g/L h OD600
	and 1.09 mol/mol, which were 46% and 18% higher than using one-step anaerobic
	process, respectively

	> Our work demonstrated that increasing PntAB activity alone had a threshold for
	improving anaerobic isobutanol production, while combination of PntAB and YfjB
	had a synergistic effect on improving anaerobic isobutanol production, leading
	to a yield of 0.92 mol/mol. Activating PntAB and YfjB also increased aerobic
	isobutanol titer and yield by 28% and 22%, leading to production of 10.8 g/L
	isobutanol in 24 h with a yield of 0.62 mol/mol.
