	> Medium and cultivation. As the preculture medium, SD-7 containing 2% ucose was
	prepared (NH4Cl, 7.0 g/liter; KH2PO4, 1.5 g/liter; Na2HPO4, 1.5 iter; K2SO4,
	0.35 g/liter; MgSO4 䡠 7H2O, 0.17 g/liter; trace elements, 0.8 ml/ er; yeast
	extract, 5 g/liter) as described previously (13). SD-8 medium (NH4Cl, g/liter;
	KH2PO4, 7.5 g/liter; Na2HPO4, 7.5 g/liter; K2SO4, 0.85 g/liter; gSO 䡠 7H O,
	0.17 g/liter; trace elements, 0.8 ml/liter; yeast extract; 10 g/liter) 3)
	containing 2% glucose was used for fermentations. The trace element ution
	contained the following (in grams per liter of 5 M HCl): FeSO4 䡠 7H2O, 0; MnSO4
	䡠 H2O, 10.0; Al2(SO4)3, 28.3; CoCl2 䡠 6H2O, 4.0; ZnSO4 䡠 7H2O, ; Na2MoO4 䡠
	2H2O, 2.0; CuCl2 䡠 2H2O, 1.0; and H3BO4, 0.5. Antibiotics were d as appropriate
	(ampicillin, 100 ␮g/ml, and chloramphenicol, 40 ␮g/ml). Preculture with 5 ml of
	SD-7 medium in a test tube was performed at 37°C ernight (17 h) on a rotary
	shaker (250 rpm); 250 ␮l of overnight culture was oculated into 25 ml of SD-8
	medium in a 250-ml flask with baffles. When the tical density at 600 nm was
	⬃1.0 (3 h), 0.1 mM IPTG (isopropyl-␤-D-thioactopyranoside) was added for
	induction. Cells were grown at 37°C for 30.5 h on

	> study, we achieved the first isopropanol production in coli. In shake flask
	cultures, strain TA11 containing pTA39/ TA36 produced 81.6 mM isopropanol at
	30.5 h with a maxium productivity of 6.9 mM/h (0.41 g/liter/h) between 3 and 5
	h. The engineered E. coli surpassed the best reported strain C. beijerinckii,
	NRRL B593, which produces isopropanol at 30 mM with a maximum productivity of
	⬃3 mM/h (⬃0.18 liter/h) (4). The isopropanol yield at 9.5 h after inoculation

	isopropanol produced (44.8 mM) and the ucose consumed (103.0 m

	production ing the same gene construction (pTA41) achieved 60.3 mM acetone at
	12 h (data not shown). In shake flasks, strain A11 containing pTA39 achieved a
	maximum concentration of 8.3 mM at about 30 h and a maximum productivity of
	12.1 M/h (0.70 g/liter/h) at 3 to 9.5 h. The acetone titer also ceeded that
	produced by wild-type C. acetobutylicum (90 M) (1). Without further
	optimization of the strain and the rmentation conditions, the acetone yield at
	12 h after inocation was already 73.5% (mol/mol) of the theoretical maxium.
	This high yield indicates a great potential for using etabolically e
