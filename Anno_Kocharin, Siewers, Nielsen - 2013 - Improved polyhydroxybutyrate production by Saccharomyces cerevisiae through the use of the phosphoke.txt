	> The strategy that resulted in the highest PHB production after 100 h was with a
	strain harboring the phosphoketolase pathway to supply acetyl-CoA without the
	need of increased NADPH production by gapN integration.

	> A more than tenfold increase in PHB yield on glucose was observed in SCKK033
	compared to SCKK005, producing 0.27  0.01 and 0.02  0.01 g/g glc,
	respectively. However, only a twofold higher PHB yield on glucose was observed
	in SCKK035 compared with SCKK032 whereas no effect of gapN integration on YsPHB
	was observed in strains with over-expression of the ethanol degradation
	pathway, SCKK006 and SCKK034. The combination of gapN integration and the
	ethanol degradation pathway was able to improve the yield of PHB on ethanol
	from 6.09  1.44 to 14.50  2.9 mg/g EtOH in SCKK034. The combination of gapN
	integration and expression of the phosphoketolase pathway, however, revealed an
	antagonistic effect on PHB production on ethanol. The strain without gapN
	integration but expressing the phosphoketolase pathway (SCKK032) showed the
	highest yield of PHB on ethanol, 56.4 mg/g EtOH, which decreased to 12.5 mg/g
	EtOH when the phosphoketolase pathway was combined with gapN integration.
