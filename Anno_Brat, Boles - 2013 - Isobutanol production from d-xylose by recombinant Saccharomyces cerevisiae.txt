	> Simultaneous overexpression of an optimized, cytosolically localized valine
	biosynthesis pathway together with overexpression of xylose isomerase XylA from
	Clostridium phytofermentans, transaldolase Tal1 and xylulokinase Xks1 enabled
	recombinant Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells to complement the valine auxotrophy
	of ilv2,3,5 triple deletion mutants for growth on D-xylose as the sole carbon
	source. Moreover, after additional overexpression of ketoacid decarboxylase
	Aro10 and alcohol dehydrogenase Adh2, the cells were able to ferment D-xylose
	directly to isobutanol.

	> Saccharomyces cerevisiae was grown in selective medium (1.7 g L  1  Difco yeast
	nitrogen base without amino acids and with 5 g L  1  ammoniumsulfate),
	supplemented with amino acids but omitting the selective plasmid marker
	nutrients (SC) (Zimmermann, 1975). Compared to SC media, SM media contained
	only the auxotrophic requirements. As carbon sources, media contained either 20
	g L  1  D-glucose  (SCD, SMD) or 20 g L  1  D-xylose  (SCX, SMX). In the growth
	assays with Isoy16 transformants, 5 g L  1  leucine + 5 g L  1  isoleucine + 5
	g L  1  valine were used as nitrogen source and to complement the branched-
	chain amino acids requirement.

	> To investigate isobutanol production from  D-xylose, strain Isoy17 was
	transformed with the plasmids expressing the xylose and valine pathways, and
	additionally with the plasmid pRS42HH7-Aro10-Adh2 expressing Aro10 ketoacid
	decarboxylase and Adh2 alcohol dehydrogenase (Brat et al., 2012). Aerobic
	fermentation experiments were performed in 500-mL shake flasks. Transformants
	were pre-grown in selective SCX medium without valine (empty vector control
	with valine), harvested and used to inoculate SCX medium without valine in
	shake flasks at an OD600  nm of 1 (Fig 3a).

	> Fig. 3. Isobutanol production from D-xylose with recombinant S. cerevisiae
	cells. Fermentation experiments were performed aerobically at 30 Â°C in shake
	flasks in selective SC-val medium containing 20 g L  1  D-xylose.  All
	transformants contained plasmids overexpressing the codon ...... optimized xylA
	gene from C. phytofermentans, XKS1, TAL1, ARO10 and ADH2. Additionally,
	transformants contained plasmids overexpressing  ...... wild-type ILV2, ILV5
	and ILV3 (closed squares), codon-optimized truncated ILV2DN54, ILV5DN48 and
	ILV3DN19 (closed triangles) or the corresponding empty vectors (closed circles)
	(in c and d closed circles overlap with closed squares). Experiments were
	performed in triplicate with  ...... given standard deviations (in a and b
	standard deviations were within the area of the symbols). a--d: OD600  nm  (a),
	D-xylose consumption (b), isobutanol production (c) and ethanol production (d).

	> Fermentations were performed up to 146 h in triplicate using different
	precultures (Fig. 3). Metabolite analysis revealed that D-xylose was used as a
	carbon source but was not completely consumed (Fig. 3b). The cells expressing
	the codon-optimized cytosolic isobutanol pathway (p425synthILV235) consumed
	about 12 g D-xylose and produced up to 1.36  0.11 mg L  1  isobutanol with a
	yield of 0.16  0.04 mg isobutanol per g D-xylose (Fig. 3c). Additionally,
	ethanol was produced but only in low amounts (0.415  0.065 g L  1  with a
	yield of 0.040  0.014 g ethanol per g D-xylose) due to the low D-xylose
	utilization rate and the aerobic conditions (Fig. 3d)
