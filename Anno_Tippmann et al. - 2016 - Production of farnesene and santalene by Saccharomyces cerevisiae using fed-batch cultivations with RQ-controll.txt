	> Using farnesene as a case study, we chose three terpene synthases with distinct
	plant origins and compared their applicability for farnesene production in the
	yeast S. cerevisiae. Differences regarding the efficiencyof these enzymeswere
	observed in shake flask cultivation with maximal final titers of 4 mg/L using
	a-farnesene synthase from Malus domestica. By employing two existing platform
	strains optimized for sesquiterpene production, final titers could be raised up
	170 mg/L in fed-batch fermentations with RQ-controlled exponential feeding.
	Based on these experiments, the difference between the selected synthases was
	not significant. Lastly, the same fermentation setup was used to compare these
	results to production of the fragrance sesquiterpene santalene, and almost
	equivalent titers were obtained with 163 mg/L, using the highest producing
	strain expressing a santalene synthase from Clausena lansium. However, a
	reduction of the product yield on biomass by 50% could indicate a higher
	catalytic efficiency of the farnesene synthase.

	> All batch cultivations in shake flasks and bioreactors were performed using
	minimal media as described by Verduyn et al. (1992) containing 20 g/L glucose,
	5 g/L (NH4)2SO4, 3 g/L KH2PO4, 0.5 g/L MgSO4  7H2O, 1 mL/L trace element
	solution and 50 mL/L antifoam. The medium was adjusted to pH 5 using 2 M KOH
	and 1 mL/L vitamin solution was added after sterilization. The feed medium for
	fed-batch cultivations was ten times concentrated and contained 200 g/L
	glucose.

	Feed

	> Santalene is another commercially interesting sesquiterpene, which is directly
	produced from FPP by a specific plant terpene synthase. In order to evaluate
	the efficiency of the farnesene synthases in comparison to another
	sesquiterpene synthase, a similar RQ-controlled fed-batch fermentation with
	strain SCIGS24 was performed (Scalcinati et al., 2012b). This strain is
	identical to SCIST10-12 regarding its genetic background and only differs by
	carrying plasmid pISP15, which contains a codon optimized santalene synthase
	from Clausena lansium (see Table II). Similar to the fed-batch cultivations
	performed to investigate farnesene production, the feed was controlled using
	the RQ, which was maintained at 0.98 on average throughout the experiment.
	However, as the batch phase medium contained 30 g/L glucose, higher biomass
	concentrations were attained overall reaching up to 25 gDCW/L (Fig. 6). This is
	also indicated by the biomass yield of 0.281 gDCW/g, which was significantly
	higher. However, the product yield of 0.006 g/gDCW amounts only to half
	compared to the one observed for the farnesene synthases. Considering the
	production of santalene, with 163 mg/L of a-santalene after approximately 30 h
	of feeding time, final titers were almost equivalent to cultivations using
	strains SCIST10-12.
