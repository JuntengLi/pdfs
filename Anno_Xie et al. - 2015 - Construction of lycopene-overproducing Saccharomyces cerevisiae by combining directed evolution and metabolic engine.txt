	> Here, we tried to assemble an unimpeded biosynthesis pathway by combining
	directed evolution and metabolic engineering in S. cerevisiae for lycopene-
	overproduction. First, the catalytic ability of phytoene syntheses from
	different sources was investigated based on lycopene accumulation.
	Particularly, the lycopene cyclase function of the bifunctional enzyme CrtYB
	from Xanthophyllomyces dendrorhous was inactivated by deletion of functional
	domain and directed evolution to obtain mutants with solely phytoene synthase
	function. Coexpression of the resulting CrtYB11M mutant along with the CrtE and
	CrtI genes from X. dendrorhous, and the tHMG1 gene from S. cerevisiae led to
	production of 4.47 mg/g DCW (Dry cell weight) of lycopene and 25.66 mg/g DCW of
	the by-product squalene. To further increase the FPP competitiveness of the
	lycopene synthesis pathway, we tried to enhance the catalytic performance of
	CrtE by directed evolution and created a series of pathway variants by varying
	the copy number of Crt genes. Finally, fed-batch fermentation was conducted for
	the diploid strain YXWPD-14 resulting in accumulation of 1.61 g/L (24.41 mg/g
	DCW) of lycopene, meanwhile, the by-production of squalene was reduced to below
	1 mg/g DCW.

	> For larger-scale cultures, a 5 L fermentor (Shanghai Huihetang Bioengineering
	Equipment Co. Ltd, China) containing 2.5 L of fermentation medium was adopted.
	The recombinant yeast strain precultured in YPD shake flask was used as the
	inoculum and the inoculation volume was 10%. The composition of the
	fermentation medium used in this work was the same as described previously (van
	Hoek et al., 2000). A two-stage feeding process was adopted for achieving the
	goal of high-cell density fermentation. First, a 1 L of feeding solution I
	consisting of 500 g/L glucose, 9 g/L KH2PO4, 2.5 g/L MgSO4, 3.5 g/L K2SO4, 0.28
	g/L Na2SO4, 10 ml/L trace metal solution and 12 ml/L vitamin solution was used
	to sustain fast cell growth. After that, another 500 mL of feeding solution II
	containing 250 g/L glucose and 250 g/L glycerol as carbon sources was used to
	induce the lycopene accumulation.

	> We then used CrtE03M to replace the wild-type CrtE in pUMRI10-LYC04 and
	constructed YXWP-111( þ). After the new strain was cultured in shake flasks
	containing YPD medium for 3 days, a lycopene production of 9.67 mg/g DCW was
	achieved, which was about 2.2 folds that of YXWP-P3-01. Meanwhile, the squalene
	accumulation was decreased to 10.23 mg/g DCW (Fig. 8), suggesting that the
	positive mutant CrtE03M indeed rerouted the flux of FPP and promoted the
	lycopene production.

	> The diploid strain YXWPD-14 gave a superior cell growth ability (23.408 OD600)
	and the best lycopene production (23.23 mg/g DCW, 159.56 mg/L) (Table 3), and
	was consequently chosen for subsequent fed-batch fermentation to obtain even
	higher lycopene production.

	> Here, a similar feeding process was adopted (Fig. 9A). After 1 L of feeding
	solution I containing 500 g glucose was fed into the bioreactor in the first
	stage, the biomass reached OD600 ¼230, while the lycopene in cells was only
	about 4.3 mg/g DCW. During the second feeding stage with 0.5 L feeding solution
	II containing 125 g glucose and 125 g glycerol, although the biomass only
	showed a slight increment, the lycopene accumulation was dramatically
	increased. After the exhaustion of the feeding solution II at 96 h, a lycopene
	production of 1.43 g/L and 22.03 mg/g DCW was achieved. Although the feeding
	process was stopped after 96 h, lycopene was accumulated continuously to 1.61
	g/L and 24.41 mg/g DCW until the completion of fermentation (Fig. 9B--D). To be
	noted, the by-product squalene in cells was kept below 1 mg/g DCW during the
	whole process of fermentation (Fig. 9B), suggesting that the FPP flux was
	efficiently pulled to GGPP and lycopene biosynthesis after we strengthened the
	downstream lycopene pathway.

	> Although the lycopene content in this work (24.41 mg/g DCW) was still lower than
	the E. coli production system (32 mg/g DCW) (Kim et al., 2011), it was much
	higher than previous reports on lycopene production from engineered S.
