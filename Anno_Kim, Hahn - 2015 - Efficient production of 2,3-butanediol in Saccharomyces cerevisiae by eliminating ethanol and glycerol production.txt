	accumulation of NADH and acetaldehyde as previously reported (de Smidt et al.,
	2012; Drewke et al., 1990; Ng et al., 2012). When 2,3-butanediol pathway was
	introduced into adh1Δ strain (adh1Δ [SDB]), the growth defect was þ
	considerably recovered (Fig. 4A), which may be due to NAD regeneration by Bdh1
	and pyruvate flux to  α-acetolactate instead of acetaldehyde formation. The
	adh1Δ [SDB] strain produced 3.4 g/L ethanol after 27 h (Fig. 4A), indicating a

	> glycerol production increased by 18% and 30%, reaching 13.3 g/L and 8.6 g/L,
	respectively, compared with WT [SDB] strain. The increase in glycerol
	production can be explained as a compensation mechanism of regenerating NAD  þ
	to maintain redox balance (Bakker et al., 2001). When all five ADH genes were
	deleted (adh1-5Δ), ethanol production was almost completely blocked (o0.4 g/L)
	(Fig. 4B). However, adh15Δ [SDB] strain showed similar level of 2,3-butanediol
	production compared with adh1Δ [SDB] strain, while exhibiting further increase
	in glycerol production by 22% (10.5 g/L after 36 h).

	> In addition, we investigated the effect of deleting glycerol pathway on
	2,3-butanediol production. Since glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase is the
	rate-controlling enzyme in the glycerol production (Cronwright et al., 2002),
	we deleted both GPD1 and GPD2 to block the carbon flux to glycerol. In
	agreement with previous reports (Ansell et al., 1997; Guadalupe Medina et al.,
	2010), glycerol accumulation was completely eliminated in gpd1Δgpd2Δ strain
	containing p413-SDB plasmid (gpd1Δgpd2Δ [SDB]) (Fig. 4C).

	> Next, we investigated 2,3-butanediol production upon deletion of both ethanol
	and glycerol pathways. In adh1Δ and adh1-5Δ strains, both GDP1 and GPD2 genes
	were additionally deleted to generate adh1Δgpd1Δgpd2Δ and adh1-5Δgpd1Δgpd2
	strains. Additional deletion of ADH genes in gpd1Δgpd2Δ strain led to a
	decrease in ethanol production, and the reduced ethanol levels in
	adh1Δgpd1Δgpd2Δ [SDB] and adh1-5Δgpd1Δgpd2 [SDB] strains contributed to the
	increase in 2,3-butanediol production levels accordingly (Fig. 4D and E). The
	final adh1-5Δgpd1Δgpd2 [SDB] strain produced up to 18.5 g/L 2,3-butanediol with
	a yield of 0.37 g/g glucose after 72 h, reaching 74% of maximum theoretical
	yield (Fig. 4E and Table 3). In addition to high 2,3-butanediol yield,
	byproduct formation was dramatically reduced in this strain (0.07 g/L ethanol
	and 0.13 g/L glycerol).

	> When aeration was increased by growing cells with 25 ml culture volume in a 250
	ml flask, 2,3-butanediol productivity was remarkably improved compared with
	that obtained from the routine cultivation condition of 8 ml culture in a 50 ml
	conical tube (Supplementary Fig. S4), suggesting that increased aeration might
	contribute to NAD  þ  regeneration through respiration or increasing NoxE
	activity. Although NoxE has very low Km constant for oxygen (Sudar et al.,
	2014), oxygen concentration might affect the NoxE activity in the fermentation.
	Taken together, flask fedbatch fermentation was carried out in YPD10 medium
	containing 100 g/L glucose with initial high cell density of OD600 of 10. After
	51 h fermentation, 72.9 g/L 2,3-butanediol was produced with a yield of 0.41
	g/g glucose, reaching 81.4% of maximum theoretical yield (Fig. 6). Furthermore,
	2,3-butanediol productivity was dramatically improved to 1.43 g/(L  h).
	Although 2,3-butanediol titer (72.9 g/L) was lower than that of previous
	reports (above 100 g/L) (Kim et al., 2013; Lian et al., 2014), JHY613 strain
	achieved the highest yield and productivity ever reported in S. cerevisiae.

	2,3-butanediol production. In our final strain JHY613, 2,3-butanediol was
	produced up to 72.9 g/L after 51 h cultivation, with 84% of the maximum
