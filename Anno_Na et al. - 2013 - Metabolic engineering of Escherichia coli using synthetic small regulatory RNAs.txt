	> We designed synthetic sRNAs to identify and modulate the expression of target
	genes for metabolic  ...... engineering in Escherichia coli  ...... we isolated
	an engineered E. coli strain (tyrR- and csrA-repressed S17-1) capable of
	producing 2 g per liter of tyrosine. Using a library of 130 synthetic sRNAs, we
	also identified chromosomal gene targets that enabled substantial increases in
	cadaverine production. Repression of murE led to a 55% increase in cadaverine
	production compared to the reported engineered strain (XQ56 harboring the
	plasmid  1 p15CadA)

	> the sRNA combinations, anti-tyrR and anti-csrA in S17-1 produced the highest
	tyrosine titer (2.0 g per liter) compared with other strains, which produced 0
	--1.3 g tyrosine per liter

	> both of which are not present in the main cadaverine biosynthetic pathways,
	increased cadaverine titers by 40.2% and 31.4%, respectively.

	> High-cell-density cultivation of the engineered strain expressing the most
	effective anti-murE sRNA variant led to the production of 12.6 g cadaverine per
	liter, which is 31% higher than that obtained with starting strain XQ56
	harboring p15CadA (9.6 g per liter)
