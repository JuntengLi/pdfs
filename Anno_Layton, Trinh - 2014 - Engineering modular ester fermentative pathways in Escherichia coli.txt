	> EcDL101 produced ethyl butyrate with a titer of 6.0070.13 mg/L and a specific
	ester production rate of 80.0273.26 μg/gDCW/h after 24 h by exogenous ethanol
	addition to the medium (Fig. 2B). Similarly, addition of propanol yielded
	5.2170.10 mg/L and 69.1671.65 μg/gDCW/h of propyl butyrate; addition of
	isopropanol produced 4.3170.28 mg/L and 57.1372.97 μg/gDCW/h of isopropyl
	butyrate; addition of isobutanol achieved 2.0870.07 mg/L and 27.0071.02
	μg/gDCW/h of isobutyl butyrate; and addition of butanol produced 2.3770.04 mg/L

	> 30.5571.24 μg/gDCW/h (Fig. 2B). Of note, EcDL101 also produced ethyl butyrate as
	byproduct in some alcohol addition experiments but at lower concentrations and
	rates than the controlled experiments. This was likely due to the availability
	of endogenous acetyl-CoA and the function of native aldehyde/alcohol
	dehydrogenases such as adhE for converting acetyl-CoA to ethanol. Taken
	together, EcDL101 achieved the highest ethyl butyrate production and exhibited
	different specificity towards  different  added  alcohols  with  the  following
	order: ethanol4propanol4isopropanol4butanol4isobutanol.

	> We characterized EcDL201, EcDL202, and EcDL203 in high-cell density fermentation
	experiments. The results show all characterized base strains successfully
	produced the targeted butyrate esters directly from glucose under anaerobic
	conditions (Fig. 4 and Table 3). After 24 h, EcDL201 produced ethyl butyrate at
	a titer of 3.2170.14 mg/L  and  a  specific  ester  production  rate  of
	39.1772.00 μg/gDCW/h; EcDL202 produced isopropyl butyrate at 0.1870.02 mg/L and
	2.6470.26 μg/gDCW/h; and EcDL203 produced isobutyl butyrate at 0.2670.00 mg/L
	and 3.7170.06 μg/ gDCW/h. Besides the targeted butyrate esters, EcDL202 and
	EcDL203 also produced high level of ethyl butyrate as a byproduct. Taken all
	together, ethyl butyrate was produced with the highest specificity (99%) and
	rate by EcDL201 but the trend appeared to be reciprocal for production of
	isopropyl butyrate (29%) by EcDL202 and isobutyl butyrate (19%) by EcDL203.
	This could be due to flux imbalance for synthesizing the ester precursors,
	butyryl CoA and alcohols, as well as the specificity of SAAT. Residue alcohols
	were produced in a range of 1.63--5.97 g/L in total for all characterized
	strains

	> EcDL204 produced ethyl butyrate at a titer of 37.167 0.43 mg/L (98% specificity)
	and a specific ester  production rate of 536.62 71.74 μg/gDCW/h after 24 h,
	yielding  14 fold higher ethyl butyrate production than the base strain
	EcDL201. Likewise, EcDL205 produced isopropyl butyrate at 1.34 70.05 mg/L (26%
	specificity) and 21.377 0.58 μg/gDCW/h, reaching  8 fold higher isopropyl
	butyrate production than the base strain EcDL202. EcDL206 produced isobutyl
	butyrate at 1.54 70.09 mg/L (29% specificity) and 23.15 71.44 μg/gDCW/h,
	achieving 6 fold higher isobutyl butyrate production than the base strain
	EcDL203. Among the engineered modular strains, EcDL204 produced ethyl butyrate
	with the highest titer, rate, and specificity. Like EcDL202-3, EcDL205-6
	produced a large fraction of ethyl butyrate as byproduct with the same reason
	as previously described

	> After 24 h, EcDL204 increased the ethyl butyrate production about 2.2 fold from
	37.1670.43 mg/L (or 536.62 μg/gDCW/h) to 87.9372.26 mg/L (1187.35724.32
	μg/gDCW/h). Likewise, EcDL205 improved the isopropyl butyrate production about
	3.2 fold from 1.3470.05 mg/L (or 21.3770.58 μg/gDCW/h) to 4.4070.22 mg/L (or
	68.9672.91 μg/gDCW/h). EcDL206 increased the isobutyl butyrate production about
	9.0 fold from 1.5470.09 mg/L (or 23.1571.44 μg/ gDCW/h) to 12.6070.93 mg/L (or
	209.10718.58 μg/gDCW/h). The yields of ethyl butyrate, isopropyl butyrate, and
	isobutyl butyrate on glucose were 15.370.43, 1.870.07, and 2.8770.23 mg ester/g
	glucose for EcDL204, 205, and 206, respectively

	> EcDL204 produced ethyl butyrate up to 134.00 74.83 mg/L (78% specificity), about
	1.52 fold increase from the previous 24 h experiment (Fig. 6B), and 36.83 72.13
	mg/L of butyl butyrate. The yield of total ester production was 4.36 70.35 mg/g
	glucose. It is of interest to note that residue alcohols, 12.39 g/L of ethanol
	and 0.37 g/L butanol, were also observed at the end of fermentation. Production
	levels of residue alcohols, suggest (1) low turnover of the alcohol
	acyltransferase, (2) high ethanol flux, and (3) a relatively high production
	(22% of total produced esters) of butyl butyrate as a byproduct when compared
	to the 99% product specificity observed in the high-cell density fermentation
	experiments. This result provides insight to the efficiency and future
	optimization of the butyrate ester modules.
