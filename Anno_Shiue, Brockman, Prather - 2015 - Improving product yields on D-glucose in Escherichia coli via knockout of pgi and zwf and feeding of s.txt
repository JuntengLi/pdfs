	> we investigate the ability of an E. coli Dpgi Dzwf mutant to consume alternative
	carbon sources (xylose, arabinose, and glycerol) for growth while reserving
	glucose for product formation  ...... In addition, the yield from glucose of
	the bioproduct D-glucaric acid was significantly increased in a Dpgi Dzwf

	> For determination of growth curves, cultures were grown in 250 mL baffled shake
	flasks containing 50 mL LB medium supplemented with approximately 10 g/L
	D-glucose, L-arabinose, glycerol, and/or D-xylose as indicated in Figures 2--5.
	Seed   cultures were grown overnight at 30 C and inoculated to an optical
	density at 600 nm (OD600) of 0.005. Cultures were   incubated at 30 C, 250
	rpm, and 80% relative humidity for 72 h. To construct a growth curve, cell
	densities were measured at regular time intervals on a DU800 Spectrophotometer
	(Beckman Coulter, Pasadena, CA), with more frequent sampling during the
	exponential growth phase.

	> For minimal medium experiments, a modified MOPSbuffered medium was used
	containing 10 g/L D-glucose, 6 g/L L-arabinose,  6 g/L NH4Cl, 0.4 g/L K2HPO4, 2
	mM MgSO4, 0.1 mM CaCl2, 40 mM MOPS, 4 mM tricine, 50 mM NaCl, 100 mM Bis-Tris,
	134 mM EDTA, 31 mM FeCl3, 6.2 mM ZnCl3, 0.76 mM CuCl2, 0.42 mM CoCl2, 1.62 mM
	H3BO3, 0.081 mM MnCl2, carbenicillin (100 mg/mL), and kanamycin (30 mg/mL).
	Seed cultures were started using a 1:100 dilution   from LB and were grown at
	30 C for 48 h in modified MOPS. Working cultures were inoculated to an OD600 of
	0.02 and induced 32 h after inoculation with 0.1 mM IPTG. Cultures   were
	incubated at 30 C, 250 rpm, and 80% relative humidity for 110 h. Adequate
	aeration for product formation was ensured with the use of baffled shake
	flasks. Samples were taken periodically, centrifuged to remove cell debris, and
	the supernatants analyzed for metabolite concentrations.

	conditions, D-glucaric acid titers of 0.40  0.02 g/L were obtained, nearly as
	much as observed in supplemented LB (Fig. 5). The yield of D-glucaric acid from

	produced, bringing the total yield of G6P-derived products to 71%.
