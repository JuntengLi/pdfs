	> l-glycerol 3-phosphate (l-G3P) was accumulated in Saccharomyces cerevisiae by
	pathway engineering.  ...... In fact, the triple mutant gpp1Dgpp2D pdc2D
	overexpressing GPD1 accumulated 17 mg l-G3P/g dry weight during glucose batch
	fermentation under oxygen limitation. This value corresponds to an about
	100-fold increase compared to that found in the wild type.

	>   were grown in Erlenmeyer flasks at 30 C on a rotary shaker at 200 rpm in YEPD
	medium (2% peptone, 1% yeast extract, 2% glucose). The same strains containing
	R  R  the plasmids YEpKm GPD1 or YEpKm were grown in synthetic yeast nitrogen
	base (YNB) medium (Difco, USA) supplemented with 2% glucose as well as
	histidine, adenine, tryptophane and uracil (final concentration of 120 mg/ml
	each). This medium is referred   to as YNB (Glc/leu ) medium. Strains deleted
	in PDC2 grow very slowly on glucose and were therefore precultured in YEPEG
	medium (2% peptone, 1% yeast extract, 2% (v/v) glycerol, 2% (v/v) ethanol). The
	YEPEG medium was supplemented with 200 mg/ml Geneticin G418 when pdc2D deletion
	strains containing one of the plasmids mentioned above were pre-cultured. In
	order to initiate batch fermentation, cells were precultured as specified,
	harvested, centrifuged and then transferred to fresh glucose medium.

	(YA101) and gpp1Dgpp2D double mutant (YA103) of S. cerevisiae  transformed
	with  either  GPD1  multicopy  plasmid R  R  YEpKm GPD1 (gray bars) or the
	empty vector YEpKm  (open   bars). Cells were cultivated in YNB (Glc/leu ) in
	shake-flasks and harvested for extraction of l-G3P in the mid-log phase of
	growth. Data shown are the average values from two or three independent
	experiments including the standard deviations.

	plasmid (gray bars) or the reference plasmid (open bars). Cells were pre-grown
	in YEPEG medium enabling growth of the   triple mutant. Then, glucose batch
	fermentation in YNB (Glc/leu ) medium was inoculated at a cell concentration
	corresponding to an OD600 of about 0.8. Samples for extraction and measurement
	of l-G3P were taken after 6 h of cultivation under oxygen limitation (see
	legend of Table 2). Values shown are the average values from two independent
	experiments including standard deviations

	> The triple mutant gpp1D gpp2Dpdc2D overexpressing GPD1 was the best l-G3P
	producer under the conditions tested. The level of 17 mg/g yeast dry weight
	corresponds to an increase of 100 times when compared to the wild-type level
	during aerobic fermentation of glucose (0.17 mg/g yeast dry weight).
