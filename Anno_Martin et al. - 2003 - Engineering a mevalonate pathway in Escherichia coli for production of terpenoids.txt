	> alternative method to produce high-value terpenoid compounds, such as the
	antimalarial drug artemisinin, in a microbial host. We engineered the
	expression of a synthetic amorpha-4,11-diene synthase gene and the mevalonate
	isoprenoid pathway from Saccharomyces cerevisiae in Escherichia coli.  ......

	> Expression of the synthetic ADS gene in E. coli DH10B resulted in a peak
	concentration of amorphadiene of 0.086 µg caryophyllene equivalent/ml/OD600
	after 10 h of growth in LB medium  ...... The peak  concentration  of
	amorphadiene increased to 0.313 µg caryophyllene equivalent/ml/OD600 (  ......
	which are rate-limiting enzymes of the native DXP isoprenoid pathway. Given
	this 3.6-fold increase in amorphadiene concentration upon coexpression, we
	suspected that FPP synthesis and not ADS expression limited amorphadiene
	production in this engineered host.

	> Peak amorphadiene production from the complete mevalonate pathway reached 3.1 µg
	caryophyllene equivalent/ml/OD600 after 9 h of growth in LB medium. This
	represents 36- and 10-fold improvements over the peak production for the
	strains with the native and engineered DXP pathway (0.086 and 0.313 µg
	caryophyllene equivalents/ml/OD600, respectively, as described above)
