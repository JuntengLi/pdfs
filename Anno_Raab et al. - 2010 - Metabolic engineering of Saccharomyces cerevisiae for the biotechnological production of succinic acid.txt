	> In this study we report on the suitability of the highly acid- and osmotolerant
	yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a succinic acid production host. We
	implemented a metabolic engineering strategy for the oxidative production of
	succinic acid in yeast by deletion of the genes SDH1, SDH2, IDH1 and IDP1. The
	engineered strains harbor a TCA cycle that is completely interrupted after the
	intermediates isocitrate and succinate. The strains show no serious growth
	constraints on glucose. In glucose-grown shake flask cultures, the quadruple
	deletion strain Dsdh1Dsdh2Didh1Didp1 produces succinic acid at a titer of 3.62
	g L  1  (factor 4.8 compared to wild-type) at a yield of 0.11 mol (mol
	glucose)  1  .

	> All yeast strains used in this study (Table 1) are derived from strain S.
	cerevisiae AH22ura3 (MATa ura3D leu2-3 leu2-112 his4-519 can1), which has been
	described (Polakowski et al.,     1998). The E. coli strain K12 JM109 (e14
	(McrA ), recA1, endA1, gyrA96, thi-1, hsdR17(rK  mK + ), supE44 relA1, D(lac-
	proAB), q  [FtraD36 proABlaql ZDM15]) was used for maintenance and
	amplification of plasmid DNA (Yanisch-Perron et al., 1985). Bacteria were grown
	in standard LB medium at 37 1C. Yeast strains were cultivated in defined
	minimal WMVIII medium (Lang and Looman, 1995) with 50 g L  1  glucose instead
	of sucrose supplemented with histidine (100 mg L  1  ), uracil (100 mg L  1
	) and leucine (400 mg L  1  ) on a rotary shaker (150 rpm) at 30 1C.
	Precultures (20 ml) were grown to the stationary phase in 100 ml shake flasks.
	Main cultures (50 ml) were inoculated with 1% of the preculture in baffled 250
	ml shake flasks. All shake flask cultivations were carried out in at least
	duplicates. For colony growth assays yeast cells were grown to the early
	stationary phase and spotted at different dilutions (10  1 10  4  ) on
	culture plates with defined minimal WMVIII medium (Lang and Looman, 1995) with
	5% glucose (instead of sucrose) supplemented with histidine (100 mg L  1  ),
	uracil (100 mg L  1  ), leucine (400 mg L  1  ) and optionally glutamate (2 g
	L  1  ). Plates were incubated for 96 h at 30 1C after spotting the dilutions

	> The wild-type accumulated succinic acid up to a concentration of ca. 0.76 g L
	1  within 168 h (Table 3). The succinic acid concentration reached the highest
	level after 48 h and then remained constant until the end of fermentation.

	> In contrast to the wild-type, the strains AH22ura3Dsdh2 and
	AH22ura3Dsdh2Dsdh1Didh1 (Fig. 2B  and C) exhibited strong accumulation of
	acetate and glycerol in the culture broth. Acetate was enriched in both the
	exponential growth phase and throughout the further course of the fermentation
	and reached concentrations of 6.4 g L  1  .

	> The additional deletion of genes IDH1 and IDP1 in SDH disruptants even resulted
	in  higher  succinic  acid  levels.  Strain  AH22ura3 Dsdh2Dsdh1Didh1Didp1
	formed succinic acid continuously up to a titer of 3.62 g L  1  (factor 4.8
	compared to wild-type and factor 1.3 compared to AH22ura3Dsdh2) at a yield of
	0.11 mol (mol glucose)  1  .

	> The constructed yeast strains with disruptions in the TCA cycle after the

	to 3.62 g L  1  at a yield of 0.11 mol (mol glucose)  1  in glucosegrown
	shake flask cultures and do not exhibit serious growth constraints on glucose.
