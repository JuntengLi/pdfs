	> The co-production of H2 and ethanol from glucose was studied to address the low
	H2 production yield in dark fermentation. Several mutant strains devoid of
	ackA-pta, pfkA or pgi were developed using Escherichia coli BW25113 DhycA
	DhyaAB DhybBC DldhA DfrdAB as base strain. Disruption of ackA-pta eliminated
	acetate production during glucose fermentation but resulted in the secretion of
	a significant amount of pyruvate (0.73 mol mol  1 glucose) without improving
	the co-production of H2 and ethanol.  ...... The production yields of 1  the
	DpfkA strain (H2, 1.03 mol mol  1  glucose and ethanol, 1.04 mol mol  glucose)
	were higher than those of the pfkA  þ  1  strain (H2, 0.69 mol mol  glucose
	and ethanol, 0.95 mol mol  1  glucose), but pyruvate excretion was not
	reduced.

	> Luria Bertani medium was used for regular genetic engineering 1  and culture
	maintenance work. Kanamycin at 50 mg mL , 1  1  ampicillin at 100 mg mL , and
	chloramphenicol at 25 mg mL were added to the culture media when necessary. E.
	coli strains 1  were cultured in a modified M9 medium containing 5 g L 1
	glucose, 0.3 or 3.0 g L  1  yeast extract, 3.0 g L  1  Na2HPO4, 1.5 g L 1
	KH2PO4, 0.5 g L  1  NH4Cl, 0.25 g L  NaCl, 1 mM MgSO4, 0.1 mM 1  CaCl2 and 2
	mL L  trace element solution. The culture medium was maintained at pH 7.0 ± 0.2
	and the trace element solution contained the following components (per liter):
	FeSO4∙7H2O, 0.21 g; ZnSO4∙7H2O, 50 mg; MnCl2∙4H2O, 50 mg; H3BO3, 15 mg;
	CoCl2∙6H2O, 100 mg; CuSO4∙5H2O, 6.7 mg; NiCl2∙6H2O, 10 mg; Na2SeO3, 5.0 mg; and
	Na2MoO4∙2H2O, 15 mg.

	> The base strain SH5 consumed all of the glucose in 12 h and produced H2 and
	ethanol with the yields of 1.42 ± 0.03 and 1  1  0.84 ± 0.02 mol mol ,
	respectively. Acetate of 0.73 mol mol 1  and formate of 0.12 mol mol  were
	also produced. SH6 did not produce acetate because it lacks the ackA-pta gene.
	On the other  hand,  the  ethanol  production  increased  to 1  0.95 ± 0.02
	mol mol  (which is higher than that of SH5 by 10%) 1  and the H2 production
	decreased to 0.69 ± 0.03 mol mol . One significant change by the ackA-pta
	deletion was the large 1  excretion of pyruvate (0.73 ± 0.02 mol mol ).

	> To examine the effect of the NAD(P)H supply, coproduction experiment was carried
	out with sorbitol as carbon source (Table 2). Sorbitol is more reduced than
	glucose, and produces 1 more NADH than glucose when converted to pyruvate. With
	sorbitol as a carbon source, the cell growth rate and the carbon consumption
	rate were reduced, and some of sorbitol was detected in the media even after 24
	h of cultivation (data not shown). However, the ethanol and H2 yields 1  were
	greatly increased to 1.49 ± 0.06 and 1.25 ± 0.03 mol mol , respectively (Table
	2). In addition, pyruvate was considerably 1  reduced to 0.24 ± 0.01 from 0.74
	± 0.04 mol mol . These results suggest that the deletion of pfkA could not
	fully divert glucose metabolism from the EMP pathway to the PPP, and not enough
	reducing power for the ethanol production was generated in SH8AE.
