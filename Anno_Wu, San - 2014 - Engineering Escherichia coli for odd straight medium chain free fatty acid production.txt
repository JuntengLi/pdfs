	> propionylCoA synthetase (prpE) from Salmonella enterica was overexpressed in two
	efficient even chain FFAs producers, ML103 (pXZM12) carrying the acyl-ACP
	thioesterase gene from Umbellularia californica and ML103 (pXZ18) carrying the
	acyl-ACP thioesterase gene from Ricinus communis combined with supplement of
	extracellular propionate. With these metabolically engineered E. coli, the odd
	straight chain FFAs, undecanoic acid (C11:0), tridecanoic acid (C13:0), and
	pentadecanoic acid (C15:0) were produced from glucose and propionate. The
	highest total odd straight chain FFAs produced by ML103 (pXZM12, pBAD-prpE)
	reached 276 mg/l with a ratio of 23.43 % of the total FFAs. In ML103 (pXZ18,
	pBAD-prpE), the highest total odd straight chain FFAs accumulated to 297 mg/l,
	and the ratio reached 17.68 % of the total FFAs.

	> The E. coli strain ML103 (Zhang et al. 2011; Li et al. 2012b), a MG1655
	derivative, was used as the host strain in this study.

	> During strains construction, cultures were grown at 37 °C in Lysogeny Broth (LB)
	(per liter: tryptone 10 g, yeast extract 5 g, sodium chloride 10 g) (Bertani
	1951), and appropriate antibiotics were included at the following
	concentrations: ampicillin, 100 μg/ml; chloramphenicol, 34 μg/ml.

	> The concentrations of undecanoic acid, tridecanoic acid, and pentadecanoic acid
	accumulated to 10.33, 19.36 and 1.83 mg/l at 24 h (Fig. S1a), respectively. At
	48 h, the concentrations of undecanoic acid and tridecanoic acid increased by
	66.7 % and 44.8 % while the concentration of pentadecanoic acid dropped by 8.98
	% (Fig. 2a). The percentage of total odd straight chain fatty acids reached
	around 3.21 % and changed a little at 24 and 48 h (Fig. 3c, Fig. S2c). With a
	higher concentration of propionate (12 mM) supply, the percentage of total odd
	straight chain fatty acids increased to 15.43 % at 24 h, about 4.8 times that
	of 8 mM propionate, and dropped to 12.62 % at 48 h due to the further increase
	of total even chain fatty acid (Fig. 3c, Fig. S2c). The final concentrations of
	odd straight chain FFAs reached 178 mg/l (Fig. 3a). For the strain ML103
	(pXZ18, pBAD33), pentadecanoic acid was produced with concentrations of 29.22
	and 45.1 mg/l at 24 and 48 h under the condition of 8 mM propionate
	supplementation, respectively (Fig. 2b, Fig. S1b). In the condition of 12 mM
	propionate addition, tridecanoic acid and pentadecanoic acid became the major
	odd straight chain FFAs. However, the highest percentage of total odd straight
	chain fatty acids reached around 3.94 %, only about 25.5 % of the highest value
	of the strain ML103 (pXZM12, pBAD33) (Fig. 3c). The total FFAs at 48 h reached
	2,010 and 1,990 mg/l in 8 and 12 mM propionate conditions, respectively, which
	were 1.48 (1,360 mg/l) and 1.41 (1411 mg/l) times of ML103 (pXZM12, pBAD33)
	(Fig. 3b). ML103 (pXZ18, pBAD33) seemed to prefer even chain FFA production
	more than that of ML103 (pXZM12, pBAD33) when propionate was added to the
	fermentation media.

	> Compared to the conditions with and without propionate in the media, the glucose
	utilization at 24 h were similar for both ML103 (pXZM12, pBAD33) and ML103
	(pXZ18, pBAD33) strains; all glucose was consumed within 48 h (Fig. S3).
	Different acetate accumulations were observed for both strains. Under the
	condition with no propionate, a large amount of acetate was accumulated; ML103
	(pXZM12, pBAD33) accumulated about 8.15 and 6.58 mM at 24 and 48 h, and ML103
	(pXZ18, pBAD33) accumulated about and 24.5 and 38.2 mM at 24 and 48 h

	> In ML103 (pXZM12, pBAD-prpE), 10 mM arabinose appeared to be the best level
	leading to a favorable induction of prpE; the total odd straight chain fatty
	acids reached 276 mg/l with a ratio of 23.4 %. In ML103 (pXZ18, pBAD-prpE), the
	condition of 20 mM arabinose showed the best result; 297 mg/l odd straight
	chain fatty acid was produced with the ratio of 17.7 % at 48 h.
