	> A genetically engineered strain of Escherichia coli JM109 harboring the
	isopropanol-producing pathway consisting of five genes encoding four enzymes,
	thiolase, coenzyme A (CoA) transferase, acetoacetate decarboxylase from
	Clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC 824, and primary-- secondary alcohol
	dehydrogenase from C. beijerinckii NRRL B593, produced up to 227 mM of
	isopropanol from glucose under aerobic fed-batch culture conditions

	> E. coli strain JM109 (Takara, Shiga, Japan) was grown in Luria--Bertani (LB)
	medium. Antibiotics were included as appropriate at the following
	concentrations: ampicillin, 50 μg/ml; chloramphenicol, 25 μg/ml. C.
	beijerinckii NRRL B593 (synonym: DSM6423) was grown in reinforced clostridial
	medium (BD Difco, NJ, USA) at 30°C in an anaerobic atmosphere (95% nitrogen and
	5% hydrogen). After 24-h incubation, clostridial cell was harvested by
	centrifugation (5,000×g, 10 min) and was used for genome extraction.

	> E. coli was inoculated in LB medium (2.5 ml in a test tube) and grown overnight
	at 30°C. The resulting culture was inoculated into a 500-ml baffled flask
	containing 50 ml of a complex (SD8) medium (Luli and Strohl 1990). The culture
	was incubated for isopropanol production in an agitation incubator (Tasaki
	Scientific Instruments, Saitama, Japan) at 250 rpm and 37°C. Glucose was
	occasionally supplemented to maintain glucose concentration more than 30 mM.
	Data represent average values in triplicate experiments. Standard deviations
	were within 5% of the mean.

	> Fermentation was conducted in a glucose fed-batch culture in a baffled flask.
	Glucose was occasionally supplemented at concentrations ranging from 30 to 200
	mM. After 36-h cultivation, 227±6 mM of isopropanol was detected in the culture
	broth, and further incubation did not increase isopropanol concentration
	...... No isopropanol and acetone were detected in a broth of the E. coli-
	pCRC200 strain, indicating that the clostridial genes were actively expressed
	in E. colipCRC202. Isopropanol yield was 51% after 36-h cultivation, and total
	solvent yield (isopropanol plus acetone) was 61%. Maximum volumetric
	productivity of isopropanol was 10.3 mmol·l ·h  under the conditions.

	> pCRC202 produced sixfold lower acetate than E. colipCRC200. The pH values of
	culture broths were 4.6 and 5.8 after 24 h in control and engineered E. coli,
	respectively. These results clearly indicated that carbon flux was redirected
	to isopropanol (and acetone) from acetate in the genetically engineered E.

	> This study demonstrated that E. coli with the five genes coding for four enzymes
	from two Clostridium species produced up to 227 mM of isopropanol under aerobic
	culture conditions

	> Acetone-producing E. coli were constructed by introducing the genes encoding
	three enzymes, THL, CTF, and ADC from C. acetobutylicum (Bermejo et al. 1998).
	The E. coli produced 93 and 154 mM of acetone in shake flask and bioreactor
	cultivations, respectively, whereas the isopropanol titer was 227 mM in shake
	flask culture of E. colipCRC202 in this study. The yield of isopropanol and
	solvent (isopropanol plus acetone) was 51 and 61%, respectively, in the present
	study. These values were slightly higher than those of acetone-producing E.
	coli where acetone yield was below 50% (Bermejo et al. 1998).
