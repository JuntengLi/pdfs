	> Herein, the yeast wa Saccharomyces cerevisiae was proposed to be metabolically
	engineered for cytosol acetyl-CoA enhancement for fatty acid synthesis. By gene
	disruption strategy, idh1 and idh2 genes involved in citrate turnover in
	tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA cycle) were disrupted and the citrate production
	level was increased to 4- and 5-times in mutant yeast strains

	> The selective medium for gene disrupted strains were YPD medium with appropriate
	antibiotics: 200 mg/ml Geneticin (G418) for single gene disruption, 7.5 mg/ml

	> Phleomycin (Phleo) for double gene disruption. The selective medium for gene
	insertion strains was YNBD-URA synthetic minimal medium (0.67% yeast nitrogen
	base, containing 2% glucose and supplemented with URA dropout amino acid
	mixture).
