	> ...... constructed by mbining FHL repressor (hycA) inactivation with FHL
	activator (fhlA) overexpression. Transcription of rge-subunit formate
	dehydrogenase, fdhF, and large-subunit h ydrogenase, hycE, in strain SR13
	increased 6.5nd 7.0-fold, respectively, compared to the wild-type strain. On
	its own, this genetic modification effectively sulted in a 2.8-fold increase in
	hydrogen productivity of SR13 compared to the wild-type strain. Further
	nhancement of productivity was attained by using a novel method involving the
	induction of the FHL complex th high-cell-density filling of a reactor under
	anaerobic conditions. Continuous hydrogen production was hieved by maintaining
	the reactor co oncentra ation of the sub strate ( free formic acid) under 25
	mM. An initial ⴚ1  oductivity of 23.6 g hydrogen h  ⴚ1  liter  ⴚ1  (300 liters

	fhlAerexpressing strain SR12 was obtained as follows. The fhlA gene of W3110
	was mplified using primers fhlA-Fw and fhlA-Rv. The amplified fragment was
	gested with KpnI and BamHI and inserted into the KpnI and BamHI sites of e low-
	copy-number plasmid pMW118, yielding vector pSR301. pSR301 was ctroporated into
	the host strains W3110 and SR11 to yield the fhlA-overpressing strain SR12 and
