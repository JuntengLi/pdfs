	> As a direct test of the capacity of engineered enzyme corecruitment to boost
	metabolite titers, we targeted the bottleneck enzymatic step of the mevalonate
	biosynthetic pathway (HMGR-catalyzed turnover of HMG-CoA to mevalonate) for
	flux  9 improvement

	> Mevalonate titers were measured for the unscaffolded pathway (GBD0SH30PDZ0 or
	G0S0P0), and improvements in production were plotted for each scaffold (Fig.
	3b). A 77-fold increase in mevalonate production (titer of ~5 mM) was observed
	for the optimal scaffold (G1S2P2). This scaffolding effect was observed as soon
	as mevalonate production was measureable (~12 h after inoculation) and
	persisted through to our final measurements (80 h after inoculation)

	> Improvement of glucaric acid titers by scaffolding the  ...... bottleneck step
	enzymes Ino1 and MIOX. Despite high initial titers of 0.5 g/l, scaffolded co-
	recruitment of Ino1 and MIOX with G 1S1P1 increased yields 200%

	> High titers of glucaric acid are generated by a pathway comprising three enzymes
	from three different organism sources, heterologously expressed using a T7
	promoter system in E.  28 coli .  Despite this high yield, we further improved
	product titers by scaffolding the two enzymes representing the bottleneck step,
	myo-inositol-1-phosphate synthase (Ino1) and myo-inositol oxygenase (MIOX),
	despite employing the lower expression Plac system. Product titers were
	improved 200% over a non-scaffolded control to produce a maximum titer of 1.7
