	> As proof-of-concept that carotenoid overproducers could serve to boost the titer
	of other terpenoids, we further tested engineered strains for the production of
	amorpha-4,11-diene, an important precursor for antimalarial drug. However, we
	experienced some limitations of the carotenoid-based screening approach as it
	was only effective in detecting a small range of pathway activity improvement
	and further increasing mevalonate pathway activity led to a decreased orange
	color. By far, we were only able to obtain one mutant strain yielded more than
	13-fold amorpha-4,11-diene over parental strains, which was approximately 64
	mg/L of caryophyllene equivalents. Further qPCR studies confirmed that erg10,
	erg13, thmg1 and erg12 involved in mevalonate pathway were overexpressed in
	this mutant strain.

	> Specifically, eight mutant strains (same strains as shown in Fig. 3) were
	transformed with plasmid pRS425ADS, which harbors amorpha-4,11-diene synthase
	gene (ADS) from A. annua for the conversion of FPP to amorpha-4,11-diene (Ro et
	al., 2006). During the evaluation of amorpha-4,11-diene production, mutant
	strains showed similar growth profiles to parental yeast strains; however,
	there was a significant improvement of amorpha-4,11-diene levels for all mutant
	strains (Fig. 4). After normalized to cell density, the best producers (M7 and
	M8) were able to produce 6-fold of amorpha-4,11-diene over parental strains
	after 5 days cultivation, which is very impressive considering that only one
	round of combinatorial engineering was performed at this moment. Based on the
	PCR validation result as shown in Figure S1, the high level of
	amorpha-4,11-diene for M7/M8 might be attributed to the integration of thmg1
	encoding the rating limiting step, which is consistent with the previous
	findings (Polakowski et al., 1998; Ro et al., 2006). On the other hand, the
	integration of other mevalonate pathway genes without thmg1 showed only a
	moderate improvement in amorpha-4,11-diene level. In particular, M3 only
	produced twofold of amorpha-4,11-diene over parental strains even though three
	genes were found to be integrated into genome (Fig. S1).
