	> The non-ethylene producing yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, was transformed into
	an ethylene producer by introducing the ethylene forming enzyme from the plant
	pathogenic bacterium Pseudomonas syringae. Cultivation of the metabolically
	engineered strain was performed in well-controlled bioreactors as aerobic batch
	cultures with an on-line monitoring of ethylene production. The highest
	productivity was obtained during the respiro-fermentative growth on glucose but
	there was also a significant rate of formation during the subsequent phase of
	ethanol respiration

	> Cells were cultivated at 30 1C in a minimal medium, YNB w/o amino acids and
	ammonium sulphate (Difco) with 10 g/l of glucose as carbon and energy source
	and 5 g/l of either ammonium sulphate or glutamate as nitrogen source. Shake
	flask cultures were conducted in 100 ml bottles with a liquid volume of 10 ml
	placed on a rotary shaker operating at 120 r.p.m. During incubation the flasks
	were left open to allow aeration while at certain time intervals and different
	cell densities of a flask were made gas tight by sealing with a rubber stopper
	in order to record the amount of ethylene formed. Ethylene formation was
	stopped by putting the culture in dry ice and analysis was performed by using a
	GC (see below).

	> Bioreactor experiments were performed by using two identical SARA Fermentation
	systems (Belach Biotechnology AB, Bromma, Sweden). The liquid volume was 750
	ml, pH was kept constant at 5.0 by automatic addition of 1 M NaOH, stirring
	rate was 600 r.p.m. and aerobic conditions were ensured by flushing with air at
	a rate of 150 ml/min.

	> Specific growth rate (circles) and specific ethylene production rate (squares)
	of S. cerevisiae after insertion of the ethylene forming enzyme (EFE) from the
	plant pathogenic bacterium, Pseudomonas syringae. Cells were cultivated in
	minimal media with 10 g/l of glucose and either ammonium (open symbols) or
	glutamate (closed symbols) as the nitrogen source. Cultures were run in
	triplicates and a representative result is shown

	> The superior productivity obtained when switching from ammonium to glutamate as
	the nitrogen source also provoked a much higher total yield of ethylene.
	Glutamate usage resulted in a total yield of 8907160 mg ethylene/g glucose (SD,
	n ¼ 3) while the corresponding value when using ammonium was only 320790 mg
	ethylene/g glucose (SD, n ¼ 3).

	> The highest productivity of 240 mg ethylene per litre and hour, obtained in
	shake flask cultures, was increased several fold by the use of well-controlled
	bioreactors and by substituting ammonium as nitrogen source in favour of
	glutamate.
