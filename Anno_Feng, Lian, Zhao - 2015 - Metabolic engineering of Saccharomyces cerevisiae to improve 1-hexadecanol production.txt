	> In order to improve fatty alcohol production, we have manipulated both the
	structural genes and the regulatory genes in yeast lipid metabolism. The
	acetyl-CoA carboxylase gene (ACC1) was over-expressed, which improved
	1-hexadecanol production by 56% (from 45 mg/ L to 71 mg/L). Knocking out the
	negative regulator of the INO1 gene in phospholipid metabolism, RPD3, further
	enhanced 1-hexadecanol production by 98% (from 71 mg/L to 140 mg/L). The
	cytosolic acetyl-CoA supply was next engineered by expressing a heterologous
	ATP-dependent citrate lyase, which increased the production of 1-hexadecanol by
	an additional 136% (from 140 mg/L to 330 mg/L). Through fed-batch fermentation
	using resting cells, over 1.1 g/L 1-hexadecanol can be produced in glucose
	minimal medium, which represents the highest titer reported in yeast to date.

	> Yeast and bacterial strains were stored in 25% glycerol at  80 1C. E. coli was
	grown in Luria--Bertani medium. Ampicillin at 100 μg/mL was added to the medium
	when required. Yeast strains BY4741, BY4742, and BY4743 were cultivated in YPD
	medium. Yeast cells were transformed with plasmids listed in Table 1 using the
	LiAc/PEG method as described previously (Gietz and Schiestl, 2007a, 2007b). To
	select the yeast transformants, synthetic complete (SC) medium was used,
	containing 6.7 g/L of yeast nitrogen base plus 20 g/L of glucose, 20 g/L of
	agar, and the appropriate amino acid drop out mix (MP Biomedicals, Solon, OH)

	> To measure the kinetics of 1-hexadecanol production in batch fermentation using
	high yeast cell density, the engineered yeast strains were first grown in 100
	mL SC medium including all the appropriate nucleotides and amino acids, with 2%
	glucose for 3 days until saturation. Then, cells from 5 mL of culture were
	centrifuged, washed twice with double-distilled water, and inoculated into 5 mL
	fresh SC medium with 2% glucose in glass disposable tubes overlaid with 10%
	dodecane (giving an initial OD600 of  3.0). S

	gene; ΔOPI1: knock-out of OPI1 gene; ACC1: over-expression of ACC1 gene; AtACL:
	expression of ACL from Arabidopsis thaliana; YlACL: expression of ACL from
	Yarrowia lipolytica; pIYC08: expression of the pathway that has been previously
	reported to enhance cytosolic acetyl-CoA (Chen et al., 2013); PEX30: over-
	expression of PEX30 gene. All strains were cultured in minimal medium lacking
	the appropriate amino acids with 2% glucose. Values are the mean of three
	biological replicates7 standard deviation (n¼ 3) after 96 h.

	> batch fermentation. In batch culture, we inoculated the cells with initial OD600
	as high as 3.0, while in fed-batch fermentation, we used resting cells with
	initial OD600 at  12.0 (Fig. 5). By using high cell density or even resting
	cells, yeast growth can be prevented so that 1-hexadecanol can be more
	efficiently converted from glucose. Within 36 h in the batch culture, 655 mg/L
	1-hexadecanol was produced from 20 g/L glucose in XF3, while 533 mg/L
	1-hexadecanol was produced in the control strain, XF1 (i.e., the strain that
	was engineered by manipulating both structural genes and regulatory genes in
	yeast lipid metabolism, but without enhancing acetyl-CoA supply in the
	cytosol). The highest titer of 1-hexadecanol was achieved using fed-batch
	fermentation with resting cells, in which the XF3 strain produced 1111 mg/L
	1-hexadecanol while the control strain XF1 produced 684 mg/L in 48 h.
	Interestingly, during the fed-batch fermentation of XF3, most of the
	1-hexadecanol ( 90%) was produced within the first 24 h, while little fatty
	alcohol was generated afterward. A similar production profile was also reported
	in another study of fed-batch fermentation using an engineered E. coli strain
	for producing C12/C14 alcohol (Zheng et al., 2012). Such a phenomenon was
	hypothesized to be attributed to the diversion of carbon flux to fatty
	aldehydes instead of fatty alcohols at the late stage of fed-batch fermentation
	(Zheng et al., 2012). Also, we found that 1-hexadecanol can be metabolized by
	S. cerevisiae, as detected by a growth assay (Fig. S1). Therefore, the
	decreased productivity of 1-hexadecanol and the degradation of fatty alcohol
	could limit the accumulation of 1hexadecanol after 24 h. Overall, through fed-
	batch fermentation with resting cells, 1-hexadecanol was produced by XF3 at the
	highest reported titer of 1111 mg/L, a 10-fold increase compared to the
	previous report on engineering yeast for fatty alcohol production (Runguphan
	and Keasling, 2013). The yield and productivity of 1-hexadecanol production
	achieved in this study were 30 mg 1-hexadecanol/g glucose and 42 mg/L/h,
	respectively.

	> The 1-hexadecanol was produced at a titer over 1.1 g/L. However, the yield of
	1-hexadecanol ( 0.03 g/g) was still far away from the theoretical yield (
	0.34 g/g), indicating the presence of other ratelimiting steps for fatty
	alcohol production.
